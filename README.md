A Python management system for organizing pickup orders.

- Django backend, with HTML/CSS Frontend. Working with SQLite to store orders. 

- Plan to switch frontend to ~~react~~ vue.js, and db to postgresql later.

### Use

To start the server use,

    python3 manage.py runserver

Changes to models/DB require migrations prior to running server,
    
    python3 manage.py migrate

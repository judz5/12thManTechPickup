A Python management system for organizing pickup orders.

- Django backend, with HTML/CSS Frontend. Working with SQLite to store orders. 

- Plan to switch frontend to ~~react~~ vue.js, and db to postgresql later.

### Use

AFTER CLONE CHANGE "Manager" folder name to "manager", ive tried changing github folder name but wont update so must be done locally, cannot run without changing.

To start the server use,

    python3 manage.py runserver

Changes to models/DB require migrations prior to running server,
    
    python3 manage.py migrate
